# Morti Capital 3.0 — Cycle 2026-11-11-c3

You hold one seat on a shared paper-trading mission: the team is taking **$100,000 → $1,000,000** in ≤365 days. Each seat runs its **own $100K book**; the team number is the average of the seats. PAPER only. Cash is allowed.

**This cycle you manage your EXISTING book** (shown below, marked at this snapshot) and may add up to 3 new trades.
Before your answer is applied, any position whose price has crossed its stop (or reached its target) at this snapshot is closed automatically.

## Hard limits (checked on your RESULTING book — violations are rejected)
- Universe: US equity ETFs, US large caps, liquid crypto (BTC/ETH), commodity ETFs. No OTC, no sub-$500M names, no options, no intraday scalps.
- ≤ **3 new trades** this cycle. Single name ≤ **10% NAV**; single ETF ≤ **25% NAV**; theme ≤ 20%; correlation cluster ≤ 25%.
- Gross ≤ **150%**, |net| ≤ **100%**. Risk per new trade or add (price→stop) ≤ **50 bps of NAV**.

## Task
1. For **each position you hold**, choose one action: `hold` (optionally tighten stop / change target), `add` (extra % of NAV), `trim` (% of NAV to sell or cover), or `exit`.
2. Optionally propose **0–3 new trades**: ticker, side (`long`/`short`), size as **% of your current NAV**, 1–2 line thesis (long/short X because Y; wrong if V by date D), stop and target (absolute prices).
Positions you leave out are held unchanged. Doing nothing is valid.

## Required answer format
End your reply with ONLY this JSON block (no commentary after it):

```json
{"actions":[{"ticker":"GLD","action":"hold","stop":0,"target":0},{"ticker":"SPY","action":"trim","pct":5.0,"thesis":"..."}],
 "trades":[{"ticker":"XLE","side":"long","pct":5.0,"thesis":"...","stop":0,"target":0}]}
```

`action` is "hold" | "add" | "trim" | "exit". `pct` = % of current NAV (needed for add/trim). `stop`/`target` 0 = unchanged. Hold everything with no new trades: `{"actions":[],"trades":[]}`. Answers are hash-committed before fills.
